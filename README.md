# Chat App

This is a simple chat application that allows users to send text messages in real-time. The application runs on a local server on your PC and can be accessed using a web browser on your laptop or mobile device. Users are assigned anonymous usernames and can join the chat room to start sending messages.

## Installation

To run the chat app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have installed Node.js, you can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install express socket.io`


This will install the Express and Socket.IO packages that are needed to run the chat app.

## Usage

To start the chat app, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

`node server.js`


This will start the server and the chat app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

To join the chat room, simply enter a username and click on the "Join Chat" button. You can then start sending messages in real-time to other users in the chat room.
